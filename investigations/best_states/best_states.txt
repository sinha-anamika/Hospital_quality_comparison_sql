What states are models of high-quality care?

Approach and justification
--------------------------

Keeping the definition of quality same as in first question, we are looking for states that have hospitals with consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

In order to answer the above question , I utilized the hospital_tfm entity created in question 1.  Again,  a hospital should have values for more than 8 measures of the higher weight("Complications and deaths") and 8 measures from lower weight("Timely and effective care " to qualify for being considered for the comparison. This means that hospitals who did not provide data for enough measures are excluded.

The final ranking is done on combined ranking of median score and standard deviation of all qualifying hospitals in a state. These two measures are being used jointly because while we want hospitals who perform well(i.e. high median score) we are also looking for consistency in a variety of procedures (i.e. low standard deviation) within the hospitals.
We use the combined ranking of (median of median score rank and median of normalized standard deviation rank). The states with the lowest  ranks are listed along  with their average score, median score, median standard deviation and combined ranking.

Please note that the combined ranking is just used to sort values. It is not associated
with the any of the columns in the table.

Conclusion
----------
The query returns Utah, South Dakota and Wisconsin to be top three states. These states names do not come to mind when we think of states with renowned hospitals. This is because we are looking for a wide variety of procedures and at the state level we are looking for consistency across hospitals.

  Hospitals are usually renowned for certain things rather than a variety of procedures.
These states are not states with dense populations. A lot of our measures are time measures as well as mortality measures. It is easier for hospitals to tend faster to patients when the volume is low and fewer mistakes are made.
