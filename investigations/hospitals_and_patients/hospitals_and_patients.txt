Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?


Approach and justification
-------------------------- 

In order to answer the above question I have considered data from survey_responses_tfm and hospital_tfm.
This survey_responses_tfm table has the raw performance rate given by the patient for seven categories as well as an overall hospital performance rate. I have created a survey_mean_score field which is a mean of seven scores in individual categories. I have not considered the converted 1-10 scores in my calculation as that is a scaled score and may have more noise.

To find the correlation between procedure variation and patient survey, I have taken the hospital level standard deviation across procedures and looked at correlation with both the hospital overall patient score as well as the calculated mean survey score.

 
RESULT
----------- 

corr_avgquality_surveymean	0.5058
corr_avgquality_ovall_survey	0.4544
corr_procvar_surveymean		-0.2765	
corr_procvar_ovall_survey	-0.2095


CONCLUSION
-----------

WHAT THE 4 NAMES ABOVE MEAN?
corr_avgquality_surveymean - Correlation between hospital average quality and calculated mean survey score
corr_avgquality_ovall_survey - Correlation between hospital average quality and overall hospital level survey score
corr_procvar_surveymean - Correlation between hospital procedural variablity and calculated mean survey score
corr_procvar_ovall_survey - Correlation between hospital procedural variablity and overall hospital level survey score


The  query results show that hospital quality has a moderate, positive correlation with  the overall patient survey score as well as the mean score. The correlation is a bit stronger with the calculated mean score rather than the overall survey score because it is driven from individual categorical scores. It is a good thing to see that the measures reported by the hospital as indicators of quality are in line with patient's judgement of quality.

As far as correlation of hospital procedural variability with patient survey response is considered, there is a slight negative correlation. This is partly because procedures metrics are very different from the type of questions being asked to the patient. Also, a patient does gets to experience only limited procedures.
